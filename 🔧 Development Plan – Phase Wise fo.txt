ðŸ”§ Development Plan â€“ Phase Wise for Blackbox AI
ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1: Setup & Handwritten Note Input (1.5 hrs)
[Frontend - Next.js]

Create a basic page with an upload form (accept .txt, .pdf, or .docx).

Allow text paste as a fallback.

Add loading spinner during processing.

[Backend - FastAPI]

Setup FastAPI server with CORS enabled.

Create /upload_notes POST endpoint to accept file or text.

If file is PDF or DOCX, extract text using pdfplumber or python-docx.

[Database - MongoDB]

Connect FastAPI to MongoDB using motor.

Store: user_id, raw_text, timestamp.

ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2: Text Summarization (2 hrs)
[Backend - FastAPI]

Add /summarize endpoint.

Load summarization model (t5-small, bart-large-cnn, or OpenAI via API).

Process text â†’ generate bullet/structured summary.

Store in DB: summary, notes_id.

[Frontend - Next.js]

Display the summary on the UI.

Add formatting (headings, bullet points).

ðŸ”µ Phase 3: Quiz & Flashcard Generator (2.5 hrs)
[Backend - FastAPI]

Create /generate_quiz endpoint.

Use pretrained NLP model (e.g., valhalla/t5-base-qg-hl) or OpenAI to:

Generate 5 MCQs

Generate 5 fill-in-the-blank questions

Create /generate_flashcards to convert summary â†’ Q&A format.

[Database]

Store: quizzes (linked to summary), flashcards (linked to summary).

[Frontend - Next.js]

Create quiz UI with radio buttons and result evaluation.

Create flashcard UI (flip-style Q&A cards).

ðŸŸ  Phase 4: Adaptive Difficulty (2 hrs)
[Backend - FastAPI]

Add /submit_quiz endpoint to accept answers and compute performance.

Store: correct_count, time_taken, topic, user_id.

Add logic to track overall & per-topic performance.

Adjust quiz difficulty in /generate_quiz using:

Easy: definitions, basic recall

Medium: concept relationships

Hard: application, analysis

[Frontend - Next.js]

Show feedback on performance (score %, suggested difficulty).

ðŸŸ£ Phase 5: User Auth & Dashboard (2 hrs)
[Frontend - Next.js]

Implement NextAuth.js for login (Google or email).

Save user session token.

[Backend - FastAPI]

Create auth middleware using JWT.

Verify token for all endpoints (summarize, quiz gen, etc.).

[Dashboard Page]

Show:

Uploaded notes

Summaries

Past quizzes + scores

Flashcards for review

âœ… Key Notes for AI Assistance
Use FastAPI with async routes and Pydantic models.

Use motor for async MongoDB access.

Token-based auth between frontend (NextAuth) and backend (JWT).

For NLP:

Summarization â†’ bart-large-cnn or t5-small

Quiz/Flashcards â†’ valhalla/t5-base-qg-hl or OpenAI

Prioritize reusability: each backend function = isolated module

Deployment:

Vercel (frontend), Render/Fly.io (FastAPI), MongoDB Atlas (DB)
